## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm / npm / yarn
- Google Cloud API key (for Maps + Gemini)
- Neon DB project with PostgreSQL
- Clerk project (for authentication)
- Vercel account (for deployment)

---

### 📁 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/greenify.git
cd greenify
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 Local Development

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file and add the following:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgres_url
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_llm_key
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### 3. Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

App will run on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Users upload waste images → processed by Gemini LLM for classification
- Gemini verifies results & categorizes waste
- Collectors receive auto-assigned tasks based on location
- Points are rewarded for verified pickups → shown in user dashboard
- AI Chatbot guides users on correct disposal & eco habits
- Clerk handles secure user login, signup, and session management

## 🔄 Folder Structure (Simplified)

```
/app               → Next.js App Router pages & routes
/components        → Reusable UI components (chatbot, modals, etc.)
/lib               → Utility functions, db setup (drizzle, neon)
public/screenshots → Add your screenshots here
.env.local         → Environment variables
```
